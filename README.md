# Telegram-Discord Bridge

This is a bridge for connecting Telegram and Discord. It's custom made so it has a few hardcoded elements, but it shouldn't be too hard to adapt it if you're familiar with `node.js`

This is poorly documented because I am not in a mood to document it. [Contact me](mailto:diogo.scf2003@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

## Running
Make sure you have `node.js` installed.

Run `npm install` and then `node bot.js`. You're done!
